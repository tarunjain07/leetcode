To solve this problem, we will use the slope property of a straight line. The slope of a line is defined as the change in Y coordinates with respect to the change in X coordinates of any two points on the line.

The property that can be used to solve this problem is that the slope between any two points on a straight line will be the same. If we choose two points from the given list of points, the value of Slope as defined above should be the same.
